## Problem Statement
- A shopping mall aims to improve its marketing strategies and customer engagement.
- The mall currently lacks a deep understanding of its customers, including their diverse profiles and purchasing habits.
- There's also a need to assess the effectiveness of previous marketing campaigns.
- This lack of data-driven insights makes it difficult for the mall to make informed decisions about resource allocation and targeted promotions.

## Stakeholders Expectation

- Stakeholders expect actionable recommendations derived from the data analysis that can be directly implemented to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement.

- They anticipate measurable outcomes resulting from the project, such as increased revenue, improved customer loyalty, and a more efficient allocation of marketing resources.


## Data Collection
 [Mall Customers Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/mall-customers-segmentation)

    Genre: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
    Age: The age of the customer (integer).
    Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars (integer).
    Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending patterns (integer).

#### Data Interpretation:
 The the above consolidated grouped-barplot depicts the following:



| **Clusters →**          | **Direct (+ve)**       | **Indirect (–ve)**       | **Special Observation**          |
|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Income vs. Age**      | Cluster-4              | Cluster-3, 5, 7           | Cluster-3 [–0.25]                |
| **Spending vs. Age**    | Cluster-2, 4, 5        | Cluster-6                 | Cluster-6 [–0.28]                |
| **Spending vs. Income** | Cluster-4, 6           | Cluster-5, 7              | Cluster-4 [0.47]                 |

**Note:** Correlation values < 0.1 are considered as zero.
<br/>
<br/>
- `Cluster-1` is mostly uncorrelated with all existing features. Assumably, they will continue to function without any intervention and create business.

- `Cluster-6` (Lowest Income Group but the Steadiest): With increasing Age, Spending decreases. While with increasing Income, Spending increases. Income and Age seem to be uncorrelated.

- `Cluster-4` (Business Class but the fluctuating income): Income, Age, and Spending increase alongside. Correlation between Income and Spending is highest.

- `Cluster-5, 7` (–ve income effect): Depicts inverse relationship between Income and Spending, i.e., with increase in income, spending decreases.

- `Cluster-2`: Exhibits increase in spending with increase in Age.

#### Data Interpretation: 
`Log-Log Regression Model` Suggest the Following :
- Overall Model Addequacy (`Prob (F-statistic) < 0.05`): Hence Null Hypothesis (all coefficients are zero) is rejected.
- The featured (Logarithmic Transformation) log-log model can explain 16.5% of the total variation in spending score (`Adj. R-squared = 0.165`).
- `Log(Annual Income)` has found to be a significant predictor (`P>|t| = 0.013`).
-  Final Thought: **1 % increase** in `Annual Income` may lead to **2.42 % increase** in `Avg. Spending Score`.
